They were then asked to fill out a survey with around 10 questions ranging from coffee drinking habits to describing the coffee flavors of the four coffees.\nI decided to analyze the results! I performed a text analysis of the coffees tasted and looked at the demographics and coffee habits of the participants. Here I looked at standard bitterness and acidity in each coffee then I went deeper to find if there were commonalities in coffee flavor notes via a text analysis. Of the 5,000 participants, a survey was completed by 4,042 of them."

    "text": "Coffee Cupping\n\nWhat is Coffee Cupping?\nMost of us have probably seen tasting notes when purchasing coffee (i.e. grapefruit, chocolate) but are these actually descriptive? Would someone describe similar notes of the same coffee? Is there a relationship between tasting notes and roast levels? To find this out, I looked at how participants ranked the level of bitterness and acidity of each coffee. Then they were asked to describe their tasting notes so I will explore this via a text analysis.\n(pictures)(flavor wheel)\n\n\nBitterness and Acidity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Coffee Bitterness Scores\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Coffee Acidity Scores\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Bitterness Statistics of Each Coffee\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoffee\nMean Bitterness\nStandard Deviation\n\n\n\n\n\nCoffee A\n\n2.14\n0.95\n\n\n\nCoffee B\n\n3.01\n0.99\n\n\n\nCoffee C\n\n3.07\n1.00\n\n\n\nCoffee D\n\n2.16\n1.08\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Acidity Statistics of Each Coffee\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoffee\nMean Acidity\nStandard Deviation\n\n\n\n\n\nCoffee A\n\n3.63\n0.98\n\n\n\nCoffee B\n\n2.22\n0.87\n\n\n\nCoffee C\n\n2.37\n0.92\n\n\n\nCoffee D\n\n3.86\n1.01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: conf.level = 0.95, statistical significant at the 5 percent levels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n2.5623\n0.0052\n\n\n0.9239\n0.1778\n\n\n9.7466\n0.0000\n\n\n6.9392\n0.0000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo start, participants were asked to rate the level of bitterness and acidity of each coffee from a scale of 1 -5. Average bitterness among the four coffees show that Coffee A and Coffee D were similar while Coffee B and Coffee C were also similar. But are these averages between these two pair of coffee statistically significant. To find this out, I performed a one-sided t-test. show that the average may be different (p = xx).\nAgain, for acidity, we have similar patterns.\n\n\nFlavor Notes\nCool we found a difference in bitterness and acidity in the coffees! So What does the coffee remind you of? was a repeated question James asked to describe the flavor notes. Comparing coffees side-by-side allows one to discover the nuances of each coffee. One may start with a general words such as ‘nutty.’ Below is a flavor wheel, a tool to help identify words for one’s taste buds.\n(wheel) This cupping live stream demonstrates there’s actually some commonalities between tasting by the cupping participants.\nParticipants were asked to describe the coffee flavors in an open text field. I did a text analysis by identifying and counting key flavor words, such as ‘bright’ or ‘grapefruit.’ I took the top 25 most frequent words and made a word cloud. The larger the word, the frequent the word was mentioned (note-the count is in the hover text).\nCoffee A conjures up images of something light and fruity. While Coffee B and Coffee C using ‘chocolate’ and ‘nutty’ as common descriptors and a few even described it as burnt. Coffee C has more of a spread in word counts.\nCoffee D, however, paints a different image. ‘Fermented’ and ‘funky’ made it to the top - given this was a natural processed coffee this is not surprising!\n\n\n\nCoffee A: Fruity: 616 Respondents\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoffee B: Chocolate: 600 Respondents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoffee C: Chocolate: 332 Respondents\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoffee D: Fruity: 1,085 Respondents\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay - so let’s see how these tasting notes match up on the flavor wheel. ‘Acid’, ‘Bitter’, ‘Sweet’, ‘Fruity’, and ‘Chocolate’ are generic words used to describe all 4 coffees. However, they were used at different frequencies as demonstrated in the word clouds. Looking at the yellow sectors, we do see a pattern for Coffee A and Coffee D compared to Coffee B and Coffee C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Overlapping Taste Notes"

Not surprisingly, we see participants lean towards the upper half with nearly half (45%) rating themselves as a 6 or 7. However, there is still a significant number on the lower end and very few at a 9 or 10, pulling the overall average down to 5.7. As to more easily compare these groups throughout my analysis, I binned one’s level of expertise into five groups. Now, the ‘5-6’ and ‘7-8’ expertise groups make up about the same proportion (36% each) while the ‘9-10’ expertise group make up only 3% of total participants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Self-Rated Coffee Expertise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Binned Self-Rated Coffee Expertise Groups"

That was very true for me as I fell into black hole of striving to perfect my coffee game, wanting to buy the top gear given my budget.\nFor the folks with less expertise, nearly half (48%) of them spend less than $20 a month. Figure 5 showed that this group does drink less coffee. They also probably don’t drink a lot of specialty coffee since a bag costs $10-20 a bag nor drink coffee at specialty cafes.\nWe find similar a pattern when asked how much a participant spent on coffee equipment over the past five years. While James says having a good coffee grinder makes for a better coffee, a decent one does cost for than $100. Again, this suggests folks with ‘1-2’ coffee expertise most likely do not own one.\nI wonder if this group has a coffee preference, one akin to Folger’s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Money Spent Each Month on Coffee by Coffee Expertise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Money Spent Over the Past 5 Years on Coffee Equipment by Coffee Expertise"
