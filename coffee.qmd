The "Great America Taste Test" is what coffee expert and British YouTuber James
Hoffman called the live stream coffee tasting event held in October
2023. 5,000 Americans participated in this simultaneous coffee sipping event. At the end, participants were asked to fill out a survey - so let's analyze the results! I performed a text analysis of the coffees tasted and looked at the demographics and coffee habits of the participants.

![](assets/maxresdefault.jpg){.centerimg height=250px}

## The Four Coffees

Participants tasted four different coffees with different roasts and
processing profiles. The coffee pods was basically it's flash frozen liquid of concentrated
coffee and participants just added hot water, preferably distilled water, as to ensure every
participant tasted nearly the exact same coffee profile.

```{r}

coffee_types = data.frame(Coffee = c("Coffee A", "Coffee B", "Coffee C", "Coffee D"), "Roast Level" = c("Light", "Medium", "Dark", "Light"), Origin = c("Single - Kenya", "Multiple - Blend", "Multiple - Blend", "Single - Columbia"))
# coffee_types = left_join(coffee_types, coffee_colors, by = c("Coffee" = "coffee_type"))
coffee_types |> gt() |> gt_theme_538() |> gt::text_transform(
    locations = cells_body(
      columns = c(Coffee)
    ),
    fn = function(x){
      color = filter(coffee_colors, coffee_type == x)$color_code
      name <- x
      # team <- word(x, -1)
      glue::glue(
        "<div><span style='font-weight:bold;color:{color}'>{name}</div>"
      )
    })
```


| Coffee   | Roast Level|            Origin  |
|----------|------------|--------------------|
| Coffee A | Light      | Single - Kenya     |
| Coffee B | Medium     | Blend              |
| Coffee C | Dark Roast | Blend              |
| Coffee D | Light?     | Single - Columbia  |

As you can see from the chart, 3 coffees with varying degrees of roast level were tasted along with [Coffee D]{.coffeed}, an experimental-like coffee due to its unique processing method - anaerobic natural process which tends to give a very fruity and fermented taste.
is a bit different. Based on these profiles, how do you think the tastes will compare?

polarizing, esp in females 1543 national coffee pour over and light

correlation bwn actual pref vs taste pref. roast level can be ambiguous

## Demographics

https://datareportal.com/essential-youtube-stats
https://www.statista.com/statistics/810461/us-youtube-reach-gender/

Nearly 3 out of 4 (74%) participants were between ages 25 and 44 years while participants were overwhelming male at 62%. While James Hoffman is popular coffee expert on YouTube, overall YouTube demographics leans female (51%) and worldwide only 37% are between the ages of 25-44. This suggests Jame's audience tend to be young and male.

Interestingly, we see a trend in drinking more cups of coffee per day as one ages. Who said college students drink lots of coffee, maybe we should say it's the retirees who drink far more?

```

## Coffee Spending Habits
Participants were asked to rate one's own coffee expertise on a scale of 1 - 10. As one would expect, as one becomes more expert, one spends more money. That was very true for me, wanting to get the is a black hole. Those who rate themself as a 1 or 2 spend less than \$20 a month. This suggests this group probably doesn't drink a lot of specialty coffee since a bag costs \$10-20 a bag. 

We find similar patterns when asked how much a participant spent on coffee equipment over the past five years. While James says having a good coffee grinder makes for a better coffee, a decent one does cost for than $100. Again, this suggests folks with '1-2' coffee expertise most likely do not own one.

Most of us have probably seen tasting notes when it comes to purchasing coffee (i.e. grapefruit, chocolate) but are these actually descriptive? Is there a relationship between tasting notes and roast levels?

To start, participants were asked to rate the level of bitterness and acidity of each coffee?

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
What does the coffee remind you of?
:::

Roast levels, processing method, region, elevation, variety, all play a role in the coffee tasting experience. Below is a flavor wheel, a tool to help identify words for one's taste buds.

(wheel)
This cupping live stream demonstrates there's actually some commonalities between tasting by the cupping participants.

Participants were asked to describe the coffee flavors in an open text field. I did a text analysis by identifying and counting key flavor words, such as 'bright' or 'grapefruit.' I took the top 25 most frequent words and made a **word cloud.** The larger the word, the frequent the word was mentioned.

[Coffee A]{.coffeea} conjures up images of something light and fruity. While [Coffee B]{.coffeeb} and [Coffee C]{.coffeec} using 'chocolate' and 'nutty' as common descriptors and a few even described it as burnt. [Coffee C]{.coffeec} has more of a spread in word counts.

[Coffee D]{.coffeed}, however, paints a different image. 'Fermented' and 'funky' made it to the top - given this was a natural processed coffee this is not surprising!

<div id="parent">
<div id="child-left">
<p class="wc_cap">[Coffee A]{.coffeea}: Fruity: 616 Respondents</p>
<iframe src = "/assets/widgets/a.html" width = "100%" height = "200"></iframe></div>
<div id="child-right">
<p class="wc_cap">[Coffee B]{.coffeeb}: Chocolate: 600 Respondents</p>
<iframe src = "/assets/widgets/b.html" width = "100%" height = "200"></iframe></div>
</div>

<div id="parent">
<div id="child-left">
<p class="wc_cap">[Coffee C]{.coffeec}: Chocolate: 332 Respondents</p>
<iframe src = "/assets/widgets/c.html" width = "90%" height = "190"></iframe></div>
<div id="child-right">
<p class="wc_cap">[Coffee D]{.coffeed}: Fruity: 1,085 Respondents</p>
<iframe src = "/assets/widgets/d.html" width = "100%" height = "200"></iframe></div>
</div>

Okay - so let's see how these tasting notes match up on the flavor wheel. 'Acid', 'Sweet', 'Fruit', and 'Chocolate' are generic words used to describe all 4 coffees. However, they were used at different frequencies as demonstrated in the word clouds. Looking at the yellow sectors, we do see a pattern for [Coffee A]{.coffeea} and [Coffee D]{.coffeed} compared to [Coffee B]{.coffeeb} and [Coffee C]{.coffeec}.
